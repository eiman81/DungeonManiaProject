We planned for and implemented 1A and completed it. Planning part was okay as we had some idea on how to go about this task but it was a difficult task to implement and also confusing but we figured the problem. It was particularly confusing putting the move body in a class so that it would work for all the enemies. Furthermore, we completed question 1B. It wasn't too difficult to find observer pattern as there was a UML diagram given. Through looking at the diagram we could find the pattern and wrote an example as the answer. We also completed 1C. 1C took a little bit of time to figure out but was not difficult when the inheritance code smell was found. It was as simple as removing abstract from the method definitions in entity class. Subsequently, deleting methods in subclasses that didn't override.
