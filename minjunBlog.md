We worked on 1C and completed it. It was a difficult task and confusing but we figured the problem. It was particularly confusing putting the move body in a class so that it would work for all the enemies. Furthermore, we completed question 1B. It wasn't too difficult to find observer pattern as there was a UML diagram given. Through looking at the diagram we could find the pattern and wrote an example as the answer. We also completed 1C. 1C took a little bit of time to figure out but was not difficult when the inheritance code smell was found. It was as simple as removing abstract from the method definitions in entity class. Subsequently, deleting methods in subclasses that didn't override.
